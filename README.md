# Energy Travel ( July 2019 )
## Portfolio Case

### Description
Energy Travel - is a landing page for one of the tours of travel agency «Energy TRAVEL». I decided to use workflow with Gulp for static assets and Webpack for Javascript. I used Nunjucks and PostCSS for templating. For scripting I used Vue.js.

## Deployment:
1. `git clone git@bitbucket.org:apptech-team/mexico.git`
2. `yarn`
3. `yarn start` - for dev
4. `yarn build` - for build
